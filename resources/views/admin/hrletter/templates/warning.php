Dear ..........................<br/><br/>

<h3>Ref: Letter Of Warning</h3>

I refer to my discussion with you in the presence of ................................................
on_______________.<br/><br/>

During our discussion, we highlighted to you your negative work attitude, unsatisfactory
performance and conduct during the last two months. Both ....................................... and I
have also discussed with you at length regarding your poor leadership quality when handling
your subordinates.<br/><br/>

Despite the numerous advice and counselling sessions held with ................................... and
myself, you have not made an effort to improve in the areas of the above said.<br/><br/>


I would like you to take our warning and advice to improve on these areas, failing which I
shall be compelled to take a more serious disciplinary action against you.<br/><br/><br/>


Yours sincerely<br/>
